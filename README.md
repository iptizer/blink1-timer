# blink1-timer

Wrote this small python script to use the [Blink1 LED](https://blink1.thingm.com/) as a Pomodoro Timer, but with different timer values.

## Prerequisits

Currently python2 is tested.

```bash
pip install blink1
```

## Usage

As a classic Pomorodo Timer:

```bash
./timer.py -t 25 -p 5
```

How I use it with different timer values:

```bash
./timer.py -t 25 -p 5
```
